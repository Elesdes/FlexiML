# FlexiML (In Progress)

FlexiML is a Rust-based module designed for a wide range of machine learning tasks. This module serves as a continuation and improvement of a previous C++ version, offering enhanced performance and safety inherent to Rust.

**Important Note:** FlexiML is a personal project created for the purpose of learning Rust. It is not intended for production use or any professional applications. This project should be considered as an educational endeavor and a demonstration of Rust's capabilities in machine learning contexts.

## Features

- Flexible machine learning model integration for various tasks.
- Efficient monument recognition as a primary example.
- Improved performance and memory safety over the previous C++ implementation.

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)

## Installation

TODO: Add installation instructions

## Usage

TODO: Add usage instructions

## Acknowledgements

FlexiML is part of a larger project for machine learning applications. This project builds upon the foundational work of the previous C++ implementation, which was developed by a dedicated team of three, including myself. Special thanks to my team members for their collaboration and contributions to the initial project.

Thanks to [burn](https://github.com/tracel-ai/burn) open-source library for providing part of the file structure and some code that was retrieved for CI elements.
