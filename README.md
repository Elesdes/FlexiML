# FlexiML

FlexiML is a Rust-based module designed for a wide range of machine learning tasks, and is intended to be used in Python projects. This module serves as a continuation and improvement of a previous C++ version, offering enhanced performance and safety inherent to Rust.

## Features

- Flexible machine learning model integration for various tasks.
- Efficient monument recognition as a primary example.
- Improved performance and memory safety over the previous C++ implementation.

## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Python 3.11 or higher

## Installation

TODO: Add installation instructions

## Usage

## Acknowledgements

FlexiML is part of a larger project for machine learning applications. This project builds upon the foundational work of the previous C++ implementation, which was developed by a dedicated team of three, including myself. Special thanks to my team members for their collaboration and contributions to the initial project.
